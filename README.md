###  About This Project
This project uses the Stable Diffusion model, originally developed by [Stability AI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion). 
Stable Diffusion is a machine learning model that generates high-quality images from text prompts. We have incorporated and adapted parts of the code into our project.
You can find the original Stable Diffusion repository here: [Stable Diffusion GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion).
