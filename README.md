# Implementation of TaciDraw

### About This Project
This project uses the Stable Diffusion model, originally developed by [Stability AI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion). 

Stable Diffusion is a machine learning model that generates high-quality images from text prompts. We have incorporated and adapted parts of the code into our project. The original Stable Diffusion code and model are licensed under the **CreativeML Open RAIL-M License**, which governs the use of the code and model. You can find the original code and license here: [Stable Diffusion GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion).

This project follows the same license terms as Stable Diffusion, and all code modifications are documented in the source files. We have added additional features, including adaptations to generate tactile graphics for blind and low-vision users using TaciDraw. 

### Modifications to Stable Diffusion Code
We have made modifications to the original Stable Diffusion code, including changes to the model's image processing pipeline and added functionality to support tactile image generation. These modifications are designed to better suit the needs of blind and low-vision users.

The modified files include prominent notices explaining the changes. Any new features are clearly documented in the source code, and the modifications retain the original license and attribution to Stability AI.
